# Programming Paradigms in the Software World

In computer programming, **paradigms** are styles or approaches to solving problems and structuring code. Each paradigm offers a different perspective and is suited to different types of problems.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Imperative Programming
- **Description**: Tells the computer *how* to perform tasks using statements that change the programâ€™s state.
- **Examples**: C, Python, Java (basic use)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Procedural Programming (Subset of Imperative)
- **Description**: Organizes code into procedures or functions.
- **Examples**: C, Pascal, Fortran

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Description**: Models code as "objects" combining data and behavior. Core principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Examples**: Java, C++, Python, C#

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Functional Programming
- **Description**: Focuses on *what* to solve rather than *how*, using pure functions and avoiding shared state or side effects.
- **Examples**: Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Elixir, F#

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Logic Programming
- **Description**: Uses formal logic. Programs are sets of facts and rules, with computation via inference.
- **Examples**: Prolog

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Declarative Programming
- **Description**: Describes *what* the program should accomplish without specifying *how*.
- **Examples**: SQL, HTML, XSLT

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Event-Driven Programming
- **Description**: Control flow is driven by events such as user interactions or sensor inputs.
- **Examples**: JavaScript, Node.js, Visual Basic

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Concurrent / Parallel Programming
- **Description**: Focuses on executing multiple tasks simultaneously for performance or responsiveness.
- **Examples**: Go, Erlang, Rust (with concurrency features)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- **Description**: Separates cross-cutting concerns like logging or security from core logic.
- **Examples**: AspectJ (Java extension)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Reactive Programming
- **Description**: Works with asynchronous data streams and propagates changes through the system automatically.
- **Examples**: RxJS, Reactor, Akka

| Paradigm               | Core Idea                            | Example Languages          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Imperative             | Step-by-step instructions            | C, Python                  |

| Functional             | Pure functions, immutability         | Haskell, Lisp, F#          |
| Logic                  | Based on formal logic and inference  | Prolog                     |
| Declarative            | Describe what, not how               | SQL, HTML                  |
| Event-Driven           | Triggered by events                  | JavaScript, Node.js        |
| Concurrent/Parallel    | Multi-threaded or distributed tasks  | Go, Erlang, Rust           |
| Aspect-Oriented        | Modularize cross-cutting concerns    | AspectJ                    |
| Reactive               | Respond to data changes in real-time | RxJS, Akka                 |

> ðŸ§  **Note:** Many modern languages support multiple paradigms. For example, Python supports imperative, object-oriented, and functional styles.
